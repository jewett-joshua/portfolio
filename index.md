# Hello!

My name is Josh Jewett. I am currently an Enterprise Security Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am passionate about weightlifting, science fiction novels, and I guess I also dabble in system design and architecture.

I created this portfolio as a showcase for myself, as well as a little pet project to work on and refine my skills.

### Skills and experience

Some of my skills I have developed in a traditional, structured higher education setting, others have been developed throughout my career, and then there are some I've done on my own for fun or just to flex. Some I attribute to my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, AWS Cloud Practitioner, CompTIA Security+, and IBM Cloud Private Infrastructure and Architecture. All of the below include skills I have had exposure with, but not limited to:

*   Computer Science as a whole
*   Cybersecurity principles
*   Cloud computing and architecture
*   Secrets management
*   Linux server admin
*   Bash scripting
*   Python
*   Ansible
*   Containers

### Work Experience

I currently work at IBM and use to be in the Army National Guard for six years. Here's a sort of highlight reel for those.
